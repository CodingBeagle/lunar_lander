The "vimrc" file, AKA "init.vim", is a configuration file which Vim executes automatically at startup.

In this file, you can place all the commands you want to be executed at every startup.

In order to figure out the directory of your init.vim, you can type the following command inside Vim:
:echo stdpath('config')

In order to learn more about the vimrc file, you can type the following command:
:help vimrc-intro
